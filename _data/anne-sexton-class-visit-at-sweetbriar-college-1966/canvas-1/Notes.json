You know, it influenced me to do that and then I ran up to my mother-in-law's where Joy was staying and got her but I could only keep her for a week. I was still too sick really to have her. I didn't get her back until then, but I did meet W.D. Snodgrass and he said, 'Why don't you sit down and write the truth' and so I did but it took me about a year. 'The Double Image'. It's a terribly hard poem because it has -- it's different from 'Heart Needle', 'Heart's Needle' because it tells a story. It has the narrative where his is a series of lyric poems.
